# Project Chimera – Cursor Rules (Prime Directive)

You are working on Project Chimera: a spec-driven autonomous influencer system using FastRender swarm, MCP, and Agentic Commerce.

**NEVER write or suggest code until a ratified spec exists in specs/**

Rules:
1. Always check specs/ first. If missing or unclear → ask me.
2. Always explain your plan before any code.
3. Write failing tests first (TDD).
4. Distinguish runtime skills (skills/) from dev MCP servers.
5. Use Pydantic models for all contracts.
6. Reference SRS sections in comments.

Violation of rule #1 = immediate rejection.
